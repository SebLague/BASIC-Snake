# BASIC-Snake

I was inspired to try create my own version of Snake in applesoft basic after watching [this awesome video by the Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r83N3c2kPw).

If for some reason you want to play it, you can paste the code into [this site](https://www.calormen.com/jsbasic/).
</br>Or you can watch a video of it in action by clicking the image below.
